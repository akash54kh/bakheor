									<h1 class="major">Hello, my name<br />
									is Armaan Verma</h1>
									<p>Besides being an ordinary school boy, I have had the greatest privilege of my life-time to act with my favourite star Shah Rukh Khan in a superhero themed movie known as <strong>Ra-One</strong>. It was a dream come true and made me a star overnight.
									I had the chance to go to Toronto which is in Canada, a place where I have always loved to go, for the promotion of Ra-One. I never knew that after this venture, I would have fans all over India and from many parts of the world.</p>

									<h2 class="major">In The News</h2>
									<p>12-year-old Armaan Verma, who plays Shahrukh’s son in the film, is quite excited about making his big-budget debut.
										The seventh grade student at Billabong International School, Santa Cruz recently talked to media for the first time about his experience of working with the King Khan.
										Armaan said that his school friends and teaching staff didn’t know that he was playing such an important role in the movie. They came to know only when they saw the promos.
										Armaan also revealed a secret about SRK. “Fortunately, I didn’t have dialogues in Tamil, since all my speech is in Hindi in Ra One. But Shahrukh Khan has some lines in Tamil, and he sounds very funny speaking it,” he said.
										Well, though his onscreen son finds his accent funny, let’s hope he at least manages to impress his Tamil fans!</p>

									<p>It was a wonderful experience, to meet the man I have always wanted to meet in personal! SRK told me that I was to play the role of Prateek, alias Lucifer (Taken from Lucifer Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies)
										and I was really excited, however, my parents advised me not to tell anyone in my school about this project and our school founder also promised to keep it a secret.</p>

									<p>The shooting was finished in 18 months. The movie was shot in Mumbai, Goa, Hyderabad and London.
										Somehow the news leaked out in my school before the shooting was over,
										and the fact that I had acted with SRK in a bollywood flick spread like wildfire!
										However, I was happy and my schoolmates were proud of me.</p>
